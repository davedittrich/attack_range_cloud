# Splunk Cloud Attack Range

## Purpose
The Cloud Attack Range is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering. First, the user is able to build quickly a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a cloud environment. Second, the Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as [Leonidas](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/leonidas) in order to generate real attack data. Third, it integrates seamlessly into any Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the detection rule testing process.  

## Architecture
The Cloud Attack Range consists of:
- pre-configured Splunk server with AWS Cloudtrail logs and Kubernetes logs
- pre-configured Phantom server
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service with a Wordpress app and [Splunk Connect for Kubernetes](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes)
- integrated [Leonidas](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/leonidas) cloud attacks

### Logging
The following log sources are collected from the machines:
- Cloudtrail logs (```index = aws```)
- Kubernetes logs (```index = kubernetes OR index = kubernetes-metrics```)

## Running
Follow [Getting Started](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range_cloud/wiki/Configure-Cloud-Attack-Range) to configure Cloud Attack Range.  
Cloud Attack Range supports different actions:
- Build Cloud Attack Range
- Perform Cloud Attack Simulation
- Destroy Cloud Attack Range
- Stop Cloud Attack Range
- Resume Cloud Attack Range

### Build Cloud Attack Range
- Build Cloud Attack Range
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a build
```

### Perform Cloud Attack Simulation
- Perform Cloud Attack Simulation by Mitre technique
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a simulate -st T1136.003
```
- Perform Cloud Attack Simulation by Leonidas attack file
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a simulate -sf leonidas/definitions/persistence/add_api_key_to_iam_user.yml -sv "user=patrick-test"
```
- Perform Cloud Attack Simulation by Leonidas attack file using custom variables and without prompt:
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a simulate -sf leonidas/definitions/persistence/add_api_key_to_iam_user.yml -sv "user=patrick-test" --force
```

### Destroy Cloud Attack Range
- Destroy Cloud Attack Range
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a destroy
```

### Stop Cloud Attack Range
- Stop Cloud Attack Range
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a stop
```

### Resume Cloud Attack Range
- Resume Cloud Attack Range
```
python cloud_attack_range.py -a resume
```
